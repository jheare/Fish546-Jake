============

Bioinformatics Winter 2015

Objectives:
  To process RAD Seq data from raw reads to usuable information for genotyping using python and STACKS. 
  To have interactive notebooks to create reproducible ~in silico~ experiments.
  To improve organization and structure of repositories to improve reproducibility. 

Notebooks for each week/project:

[Week 1](https://github.com/jheare/Fish546-Jake/blob/master/nb/Week1Notebook.md)

[Week 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jheare/Fish546-Jake/blob/master/nb/RAD-Seq%20Process.ipynb)


Repository Organization:

So far this repository uses this organization (generic file names unless calling specific file):

Fish546-Jake/

~/README.md

~/.gitattributes


/nb

~/.ipynb_checkpoints/

~/project process related notebook.ipynb


/data

~/month created process barcode version number.csv

~/process_radtags.log

Outside of the repository I am using a /radseqdata/ directory on local machines to house the larger data files that cannot be stored on github but are needed for the coding to work.

Test files will be included in a subdirectory called

/test

Scripts will be included in a subdirectory called

/scripts
