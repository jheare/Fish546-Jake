Notebook for Week 1 of Fish 546. 

I wish to learn how to process and analyze RAD-Seq data for use with my thesis and future manuscript.
This includes processing RAD-Tags, aligning sequences, discovering SNPS, and developing genotypes from data. 

My data is currently unprocessed RAD-Seq data from samples collected before outplantation of the F1 generation of oysters produced
from broodstock collected in Oyster Bay, Dabob Bay, and Fidalgo Bay. 

I have experience with Git, python, R, and iplant so I hope I can use all of these to develop the skills I need to process and 
analyse the RAD-Seq data by the end of the quarter. 

My raw data is [here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/trilobite/index.php?dir=Crassostrea_gigas_HTSdata%2Fbatterbox%2FRADoly_01%2F) and on [nightingale](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/).
