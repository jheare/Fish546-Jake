# Year 1 Sample RAD Seq #
***
## DNA Isolation ##
Samples collected at the end of year one (Oyster Bay = September 2014; Manchester and Fidalgo = October 2014) are considered to be high quality as they are the most recently collected. 

Using Qiagen's 96 well plate protocol we will take 30 samples from each site (10 from each pop) and isolate DNA for RAD Seq library prep.
